# Mentorship Pairing Program for Industrial Engineering Club

## Project Overview
This project automates the process of pairing mentors and mentees for the Industrial Engineering Club using data from forms filled out by both mentors and mentees. The goal is to create compatible matches based on interests, career goals, and personal preferences. To achieve this, Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques were employed to clean and standardize the data, ensuring accurate matching.

## Key Features
- **Data Collection**: Forms were used to collect information about the mentors and mentees, including hobbies, career interests, and preferences.
- **Data Cleaning and Normalization**: NLP techniques, such as lemmatization, were applied to standardize responses, making them easier to compare.
- **Custom Matching Algorithm**: Developed a weighted scoring system that prioritizes certain preferences (e.g., gender preference, hobbies, career interests) to find the most compatible mentor-mentee pairs.
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Used to analyze and normalize text data, making it possible to extract key information from unstructured responses.
- **Manual Categorization**: Created a dictionary to manually sort key terms (e.g., hobbies, languages, career fields) for more accurate matching.

## Tech Stack
- **Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NLTK, NumPy
- **Algorithm**: Custom scoring algorithm that prioritizes mentee preferences

## Business Impact
This project simplifies and streamlines the mentorship pairing process for the club, ensuring that mentees are paired with mentors who share similar interests and preferences. The automation not only saves time but also improves the overall quality of the mentorship experience by creating better matches.
